| "Steel cut oats are chewy, nutty, great for you, and a pleasure to eat. Making them in the Instant Pot (this is the Instant Pot model I have owned for years and love) makes the entire process hands free.<br/><br/>Steel cut oatmeal also reheats beautifully, meaning you can make a big batch, then enjoy healthy leftovers all week long.<br /><br />... Steel cut oats are a less processed version of rolled, quick, or instant oats. To make them cook more quickly, rolled, quick, and instant oats are steamed, flattened, and pulverized to varying degrees, with rolled oats being the least processed and instant oatmeal being *very* processed and pulverized." |      |
